                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Eli. I'm a mobile (React Native) and web (React,
                    React Native Web) developer currently based in Vancouver,
                    BC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently building React Native apps for all kinds of
                    companies. I like using TypeScript to create beautiful,
                    functional, and maintainable applications. If you'd like to
                    discuss app development or React Native with me, please get in touch! You can connect with me on most major platforms.
                </p>
                <h3>Work</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm currently contracting as the lead mobile developer for a
                    startup in the pet industry. With thousands of active users,
                    and a high rating on both app stores, I've been responsible
                    for all aspects of its development and its deployment. The
                    React Native portions of the app are written entirely in
                    TypeScript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I recently built a worksite safety training app that will
                    help make worksites safer, more productive, and friendlier.
                    This application runs a Ruby on Rails back-end along with a
                    React Native client mobile app. With daily
                    push-notifications and various types of user accounts, it
                    serves videos, images and carousel assets in the form of a
                    daily quiz app. I was responsible for the entire
                    implementation of the backend and the app itself including
                    data modelling, api design, deployment and implementations.
                    The front-end is written in TypeScript and uses Expo.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've also worked on mobile apps in the travel sector and
                    sports industries for startups in NYC. In both cases, I
                    optimized their deployment toolchains, quashed bugs,
                    introduced best practices, developed new features, and
                    refactored parts of the code to TypeScript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also regularly help
                    <a href="https://g2i.co" target="_blank">G2i</a> with their
                    technical vetting process, wherein I conduct technical
                    interviews with prospective contractors, and regularly
                    review applicants code for the code-challenge section of
                    becoming a part of the collective.
                </p>
