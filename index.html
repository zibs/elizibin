                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Eli. I'm a software developer working remotely from
                    Vancouver, BC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently develop mobile apps in
                    <strong>React Native</strong>, and web apps in
                    <strong>React, React Native Web</strong>,
                    <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, as well as work on
                    <strong>Shopify Plus stores and custom apps</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm currently building apps for all kinds of companies and
                    industries. I like using TypeScript (when possible) to
                    create beautiful, functional, and maintainable applications.
                    If you'd like to discuss software development or any of the
                    above technologies with me, please get in touch! You can

                <h3>Work</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm currently helping develop React Native apps for IoT
                    smart home devices. The apps are written in TypeScript, use
                    GraphQL, and make use of a wide variety of apis and native
                    modules, including things like background-tasks, geofences,
                    and platform-specific UI patterns. I've also written GitHub
                    actions and custom build scripts which can deploy the apps
                    to their respective app stores (using fastlane and other
                    processes), as well as run the test suite. The apps are live
                    in both stores and well-rated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also currently develop and help maintain multiple Shopify
                    Plus stores. Here I implement theme updates and features
                    (such as subscriptions or a/b tests), create reusable and
                    composable product pages, optimize UX/UI for conversion,
                    enhance mobile-views, integrate with 3rd party apps, and
                    write any additional html/css/js or custom apps as needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I recently finished consulting as the front-end developer
                    for a startup in the vet & pet industry. The React & React
                    Native portions of the apps are written entirely in
                    TypeScript. The apps had features such as live-messaging,
                    scheduling, custom form generation, as well as stripe
                    integrations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've also built a worksite safety training app that will
                    help make worksites safer, more productive, and friendlier.
                    This application runs a Ruby on Rails back-end along with a
                    React Native client mobile app. With daily
                    push-notifications it serves videos, images and carousel
                    assets in the form of a daily quiz app to reinforce good
                    habits. I was responsible for the entire implementation of
                    the backend and the app itself including data modeling, api
                    design, deployment and implementations. The front-end is
                    written in TypeScript and uses Expo.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've also worked on mobile apps in the travel sector and
                    sports industries for startups in NYC. In both cases, I
                    optimized their deployment toolchains, quashed bugs,
                    introduced best practices, developed new features, and
                    refactored parts of the code to TypeScript.
                </p>
